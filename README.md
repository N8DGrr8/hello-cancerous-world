# hello-cancerous-world
<h>A repository for experimenting and getting the "hang" of Github.<h/> 
<p>Hello you cancerous world and welcome to my repository. I am a beginner to both Github and coding alike, so instead of being cancerous about it, have some quantity of understanding about my new, long, but glorious path down to success with coding and Github. For now, I will continue to learn about Github, web-developement, and coding in general. <p/>
<p2>To start off, I have constructed myself a wonderful repository, with a wonderful, new branch. If you don't like it, no need to tell, just p*** off. Cheers!<p2/>
